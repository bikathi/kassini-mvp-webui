# Kassini-mvp Web UI

## Technologies and Metadata
**Stack**: JVueJS, Javascript, Vite

**Database**: N/A

**Author**: Bikathi Martin([Github](https://github.com/bikathi))

**Status**: Incomplete, Facing Little to No Contribs*

## What is This?
This was built as a POC(Proof of Concept) attempt at building a web interface for a social-media/ B2B/ B2C platform. However, **urgent matters** caused me to side
the project a little bit.

## Is it Abandoned?
No so much. I will be updating it from time to time but don't count on that. Hey, it's Open Source so feel free to update the code with anything you want.
